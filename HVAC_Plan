Sectional Zones
PID Tuning
- If the controller is attempting to heat a zone, yet, the zones temperature does not rise, 
perhaps there is a problem at the physical level. Send an alarm value to alert the user of a potential problem. 
There will be other sensors monitoring other environmental factors that will be able to work together to create a complete 
picture of the internal environment.
